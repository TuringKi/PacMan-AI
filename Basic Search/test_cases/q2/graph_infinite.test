# Graph where natural action choice leads to an infinite loop
class: "GraphSearchTest"
algorithm: "breadthFirstSearch"

# The following section specifies the search problem and the solution.
# The graph is specified by first the set of start states, followed by
# the set of goal states, and lastly by the state transitions which are
# of the form: 
#      <start state> <actions> <end state> <cost>
#
#  B <--> C
#  ^     /|
#  |    / |
#  V   /  V
# *A<-/  [G]
